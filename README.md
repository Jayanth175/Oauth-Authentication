# OAuth Authentication Project  
A full-stack web application implementing OAuth 2.0 Authentication with Google and Local Authentication (email/password) using Node.js, Express, Passport.js, and MongoDB. This project demonstrates how to integrate Google OAuth for user authentication and securely manage local user accounts.  
## Features  
Google OAuth Authentication:
Secure login with Google.  
Access user profile and email via Google APIs.  
## Local Authentication:
User registration and login using email and password.  
Password hashing with bcrypt for security.  
## JWT Integration:  
Generate and display a JWT access token upon successful login.  
## Session Management:  
Maintain user sessions using express-session.  
## MongoDB Integration:  
Store user data (Google and local accounts) securely in MongoDB.  

Hereâ€™s a professional and comprehensive README.md for your OAuth Authentication project. You can customize it based on additional details or preferences.
